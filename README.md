## Programming Language
Python 



## Problem 1 - Calculator using Class
A simple calculator class that performs:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division (with check for division by zero)

Inputs:
- `a` (float)
- `b` (float)
- `operation` (string: "add", "subtract", "multiply", "divide")



## Problem 2 - Generate First N Odd Numbers
Given an integer input `a`, this program prints the first `a` odd numbers starting from 1.

Example:
- Input: 4  
- Output: 1, 3, 5, 7



## Problem 3 - Conditional Odd Number Series
Given an integer `a`, this program prints:
- If `a` is odd: first `a` odd numbers  
- If `a` is even: first `a-1` odd numbers

Example:
- Input: 6  
- Output: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 (same as input 5)



## Problem 4 - Count Multiples in a List
Given a list of integers, this program counts how many numbers are divisible by each integer from 1 to 9 and returns a dictionary with counts.

Example:  
Input: `[1, 2, 8, 9, 12, 46, 76, 82, 15, 20, 30]`  
Output: `{1: 11, 2: 8, 3: 4, 4: 4, 5: 3, 6: 2, 7: 0, 8: 1, 9: 1}`
